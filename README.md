## Brief History of Golang 

<em>Ten years ago, Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson started sketching the concept and goals for a new programming language â€” Golang. Two years later Go was released to the public as an open source project. Since then lots of people have been using it for various purposes. Go language is growing rapidly, although it has both many fans and many critics.</em>

## Why Golang?

The computing landscape today is almost unrelated to the environment in which the languages being used, mostly C++, Java, and Python, had been created. The problems introduced by multicore processors, networked systems, massive computation clusters, and the web programming model were being worked around rather than addressed head-on. Moreover, the scale has changed: today's server programs comprise tens of millions of lines of code, are worked on by hundreds or even thousands of programmers, and are updated literally every day. To make matters worse, build times, even on large compilation clusters, have stretched to many minutes, even hours.</br></br>
Go was designed and developed to make working in this environment more productive. Besides its better-known aspects such as built-in concurrency and garbage collection, Go's design considerations include rigorous dependency management, the adaptability of software architecture as systems grow, and robustness across the boundaries between components.
